**Project Overview:**

This project is designed to create random passwords according to user-specified criteria and assess their strength based on length.

**Design Choices:**

1. **Random Password Generation:** Utilizes simple random number generation techniques to create passwords within the specified length and character set.

2. **Password Strength Evaluation:** Determines password strength based on its length, categorizing passwords as "Low," "High," or "Very High."

3. **User Interaction:** Prompts users via console input to specify password criteria, with yes/no options for including different character types.

4. **Error Handling:** Detects when no character types are selected and informs the user before exiting the program.
