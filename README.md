**Project Summary: Password Generator**

**Overview:**
The project aimed to create a simple tool that generates random passwords based on user preferences. Users can specify the password length and choose whether to include digits, letters (uppercase and lowercase), and symbols. The program then generates a password and evaluates its strength based on its length.

**Design Approach:**
1. **Modular Design:** The program was broken down into smaller functions for easier understanding and maintenance.
  
2. **User Interaction:** Users interact with the program through simple prompts and inputs, making it easy to customize password generation.

3. **Random Password Generation:** The program constructs a character set based on user preferences and uses it to generate a random password.

4. **Password Strength Evaluation:** Password strength is evaluated based on length, with passwords categorized as "Very High," "High," or "Low" strength.

**Challenges:**
1. **Handling User Preferences:** Ensuring proper construction of the character set based on user choices was a challenge.

2. **User Input Handling:** Robust error handling and validation of user inputs, especially when users did not select any character sets, required attention.

**Conclusion:**
The password generator project provides users with a straightforward tool for generating random passwords.
